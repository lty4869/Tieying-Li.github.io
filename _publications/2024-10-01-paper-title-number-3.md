With the explosive growth of multimodal Internet data, cross-modal hashing retrieval has become crucial for semantically searching instances across different modalities.
However, existing cross-modal retrieval methods rely on assumptions of perfect consistency between modalities and between modalities and labels, which often do not hold in real-world data.
We introduce two types of inconsistency: Modality-Modality (M-M) and Modality-Label (M-L) inconsistencies. We further validate the prevalent existence of inconsistent data in multimodal datasets and highlight it will reduce the accuracy of existing Cross-Modal retrieval methods.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Inconsistency Alleviated Cross-Modal Retrieval (IA-CMR), addressing challenges posed by these inconsistencies.
