Query-based moment retrieval aims to localize the most relevant moment in an untrimmed video according to the given natural language query. Existing retrieval models require the same length for easy training and use. Therefore, videos with different lengths are pre-processed using the fixed sampling method. As a result, the longer the video, the more video clips are lost, thus affecting the accuracy of retrieval. We observed the fixed sampling method causes two accuracy issues, including missing clips and sparse clips. In this paper, we propose an adaptive video clip sampling method including resampling missing clips and enhancing sparse sampled clips to increase the retrieval accuracy
