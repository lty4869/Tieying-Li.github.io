I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the DBIA Laboratory within the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor [Xiaochun Yang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yangxiaochun/zh_CN/index/97024/list/index.htm). My research focuses on multimodal learning, encompassing cross-modal hash retrieval, multimodal data analysis, and the exploration of intermodal relationships during multimodal learning processes. I am strongly convinced that the importance of investigating fusion, alignment, and ubiquitous mapping relationships across diverse modalities to comprehend the intricacies of multimodal data and enhance the efficacy of multimodal learning systems, which promisingly make the multimodal learning as a pivotal domain in AI advancement.
